            <p class="wrapper">I optimised the planform shape of APEX's fins through theoretical analysis and computational fluid dynamics to achieve a 1 calibre static margin with the lowest possible drag.<br/><br/>The stability of a rocket is a measure of its tendency to return to vertical flight under perturbations caused by wind or other forces. For rockets without thrust-vectoring, this is achieved through the use of fins. The effect of the fins can be quantified by comparing the positions of the center of pressure and center of gravity. For a rocket to be considered stable, the center of pressure should be at least 1 body diameter (1 calibre) aft of the center of gravity.<br/><br/>It is important to note that factors including geometry and mach number also play an important role in the stability of a rocket. When optimising the fins on APEX, a static margin of >1 calibre throughout the flight was required by the team and the UKRA. However, APEX's target is to break the UK I-Class amateur rocket altitude record, and fins contribute significantly to the drag of a rocket. Using standard trapezoidal or elliptical fins would have made it difficult, if not impossible, to achieve our target altitude of 3200m.<br/><br/>The fin optimisation started with an investigation into existing planform shapes and their effectiveness at different speeds. APEX will spend a period of time in supersonic flight, which has a significant effect on stability and drag. Four potential fin shapes were identified, including a swept trapezoidal fin and a curved delta-style fin inspired by the Concorde aircraft. These were each modelled in Fusion360 with the same rounded cross-section, at the same thickness. The size of the planform for each shape was dictated by the size required to achieve a stability margin of 1 calibre at launch, calculated using openRocket.<br/><br/>Each fin model was then tested at four different speeds; 70, 200, 300, and 450 m/s using StarCCM+. For these tests, the accuracy of the fin geometry was important, so a relatively fine mesh was used. The small mesh size meant that it was only computationally efficient to test the isolated fin geometry, negating any effects of the rocket body and its boundary layer. This was deemed unlikely to affect the relative performance of each fin, and meant that each simulation took less than 36 hours to run. Meshing used a polyhedral 3D volume mesher, in an external flow field, with the base size found through a brief mesh convergence study. For the subsonic test at 70 m/s, an ideal gas physics model was used, whilst the other simulations utilised a real gas model for accurate prediction of compressibility effects.<br/><br/>The k-epsilon RANS turbulence model was selected due to its good performance in high-Re flow and relatively fast convergence. With the benefit of hindsight, a laminar model may have been more suitable for these tests, as the fins were tested at a 0&#176; angle of attack. The use of a turbulence model is unlikely to have significantly skewed results, although may have unnecessarily slowed the simulation down.<br/><br/>The results of these simulations, using a force coefficient to calculate the drag on each fin, clearly demonstrated an improvement in performance when using the curved delta-style fin. For this reason, it was implemented on the final APEX rocket, which is expected to fly in Summer 2021. This result fits the predicted outcome as the majority of the fin area was further aft, meaning that the center of pressure was also further aft. This meant that, for a smaller fin, the overall stability of the rocket could be maintained when using a delta-style planform. For this reason, the delta-style fin experienced the least drag in testing. Additionally, delta fins are used on many supersonic aircraft because of their behaviour above Mach 1, reducing wave drag compared to other planforms. The image below, and video above, illustrate the final fin design on a full-rocket simulation of APEX, with their unique curved shape.<br/><br/></P>

            <p class="wrapper"><br/>This project served as an excellent introduction to CFD and compressible flow, and ultimately led to the inclusion of a curved delta-style fin on APEX. These simulations could have been improved in a number of ways, particularly since this was my first experience using 3D flows in StarCCM+. A more in-depth mesh convergence study would have been a helpful approach to verification of the results, and a proper investigation into the choice of turbulence models may have been beneficial. Additionally, testing the fins at different angles of attack could have been conducted to explore their lift characteristics. Simulations of future rockets, such as ASCENSION, are planned to test the entire rocket using more advanced approaches to CFD.<br/><br/></p>
