            <h2 class="wrapper">The Altitude Record Team at Imperial College London Rocketry<br/><br/></h2>
            <p class="wrapper">The Altitude Record Team (ART) is a small sub-team of Imperial College London Rocketry (ICLR), with a particular focus on breaking United Kingdom Rocketry Association (UKRA) altitude records. The team is relatively young, having formed in 2019, and currently has plans for three rockets, with one successful launch.<br/><br/>ART is split into a number of smaller sub-teams, with responsibilities for different rocket performance criteria and components. As lead aerodynamics and simulations engineer, I lead our small team of aerodynamicists in simulating the behaviour of the rocket using OpenRocket, StarCCM+, ASTOS, and other packages. The majority of effort is placed on pre-apogee performance, which has the greatest impact on altitude record attempts, although we also work with the recovery, structures and avionics sub-teams to consider post-apogee performance, structural integrity and data acquisition.<br/><br/></p>

            <p class="wrapper">ASTRA served as the team's first ever rocket, and an excellent test bed for future rocket components. Developed in early 2021, it took its first flight on the 11th April 2021, reaching an apogee of 546m.<br/><br/></p>

            <p class="wrapper"><br/>ASTRA's first flight provided excellent validation of OpenRocket predictions for low-mach flight (M&#60;0.3). The simulated velocity and altitude profiles matched avionics data, particularly before apogee. The shock cord came untied from a recovery eye bolt when the streamer was deployed, causing the upper body tube to undergo ballistic descent. This lightened the load under the parachute, likely causing the slower descent visible in the altitude plot. Aside from the loss of the upper body tube, all components worked well, and avionics data matched simulations as expected. Most importantly, apogee predictions were accurate to less than 5m.<br/><br/></p>

            <p class="wrapper"><br/>ASTRA flew a second time in June 2021, with improved recovery systems. It successfully flew to an altitude of 523m, validating OpenRocket predictions further. ASTRA is expected to fly again, providing an excellent test-bed for future rocket components. Lessons from ASTRA's launch have been documented and applied in order to improve the design, manufacture, and launch procedure, bringing ART one step closer to breaking our first record. <a href="Proj1/ASTRA.mp4">Click here to see ASTRA's first flight.</a><br/><br/></p>

            <h3 class="wrapper">APEX</h3>
            <p class="wrapper">APEX is ART's first record attempt, aiming to break the UKRA I-class altitude record. Using a single motor, it will aim to fly higher than 2804m (9199ft), travelling at supersonic speeds and calling for a highly-optimised design. APEX is a step up from ASTRA, using advanced CFD for aerodynamic optimisation. The first flight of APEX was attempted on August 28th 2021 at the Scottish Amateur Rocketry Association (SARA) International Rocketry Week event in Glasgow. The rocket itself performed well in ground tests, although an issue was identified with the GPS/ SMS avionics system which was necessary for recovering the rocket. While it would have been possible to launch, the team made the decision not to do so in order to improve the faulty modules to improve the chance of retrieving the rocket after flight. As of September 2021, work is underway to make minor improvements to APEX in preparation for a rescheduled launch date.<br/><br/></p>

            <p class="wrapper"><br/><br/><br/>One of the most apparrent issues when developing APEX was the failure of OpenRocket to simulate behaviour near the speed of sound. This is beacuse of the complexity of modelling wave drag, particularly without the use of CFD. The approximations made by OpenRocket are difficult to validate, so simulations are expected to be less accurate than for low-mach flights.<br/><br/>To account for the issues caused by OpenRocket's approximations, CFD was used to optimise the rocket's aerodynamics, with a particular focus on nose shape and fin planform. APEX's fins were optimised through CFD testing using StarCCM+, for speeds above and below mach 1. It was found that a curved 'delta-style' fin was optimal, providing the greatest stability for the lowest drag.<br/><br/></p>
