            <h3 class="wrapper">APEX</h3>
            <p class="wrapper">The APEX family of rockets are designed to break  UKRA altitude records for various motor classes. Rocket motors are classified based on their total impulse (essentially a measure of the 'amount of push' they provide). The ICLR Altitude Record Team now holds the record for an I-Class rocket and aims to break G and K class records in 2023.<br/><br/></p>
            
            <p class="wrapper"><b>APEX G</b> will need to exceed 5447ft (1660m). It will rely on technology used in the launch of APEX I, and is currently on track to launch in April 2023.<br/><br/></p>

            <p class="wrapper"><b>APEX I</b> reached 9333ft (3845m) with a single motor, breaking the previous record of 9199ft. It travelled at supersonic speeds (Mach 1.55) thanks to it's highly optimised design. The team are hoping to break this record with a second launch in April 2023.<br/><br/></p>

            <p class="wrapper"><b>APEX K</b> will reach new highs, with a target altitude exceeding 6km! The existing K-class record sits at 19462ft (5932m), and significant R&D is underway to smash this altitude. Data and testing from all of the ASTRA family launches will be crucial in developing the rocket, with a target launch date in Spring/ Summer 2023.<br/><br/></p>

            <p class="wrapper"><a href="https://engineering.esteco.com/modefrontier/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ESTECO</a> kindly provide ICL Rocketry with licenses to use their powerful multidisciplinary optimisation (MDO) software, modeFrontier. This 'plugs in' to many engineering modelling packages and can be used to optimise complex designs in much shorter timeframes, and with much greater control over simulations, than our previous methods. The team are still working out how to make the most of the software, but successfully used it to break the I-Class record with APEX-I, and plan to use it to optimise the even larger APEX-K. We're producing reports to document some of this progress, which can be found below:
