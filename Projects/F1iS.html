            <h2 class="wrapper">A simple introduction to computational fluid dynamics for F1inSchools students<br/><br/></h2>
            <p class="wrapper">This document is designed to introduce young (GCSE/ A-Level) students to computational fluid dynamics, without the use of advanced mathematics. This was written for F1inSchools teams, but applies to other applications of CFD as well. It is possible to explain, in broad terms, how most CFD programs work and their applications and limitations without the use of degree-level mathematics. In particular, this document focuses on how to properly prepare for and analyse simulations using GUI-based CFD programs. It is important to note that this is not a fully comprehensive guide, and every software uses a slightly different approach. Readers are encouraged to <a href="mailto:naj20@ic.ac.uk">email me</a> if they would like clarification on any points, or if they spot an error. It should be noted that this is <b>not</b> a peer-reviewed document, and it should not be treated as anything more than a guide.<br/><br/></p>
