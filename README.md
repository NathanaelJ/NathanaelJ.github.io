I'm no HTML developer... or any kind of developer for that matter.
This is a 'just for fun' project to explore the basics of HTML and CSS (and boy do I have a new respect for web developers!)

Found an issue, or got some tips? Do let me know! Contact details are in the footer of my website... assuming the footer is working.
