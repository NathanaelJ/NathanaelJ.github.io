The author discusses how case numbers have risen at an unprecedented rate, but he also discusses the important difference between cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. Overall, this visualization does a good job of conveying the key point that Omicron was spreading faster than any other variant; placing this data at the top <b>does highlight the intended message to the audience</b>, while the spiral, and the arrows next to the year labels, <b>guide the audience to read the design from the center</b>, working outwards. Previous outbreak &#39;waves&#39; are identifiable and the visualization is relatively <b>free of clutter</b>. However, the <b>title fails to explain</b> how &#39;cases&#39; were defined (is it reports, positive tests, or hospitalizations?); since the audience is non-expert, this is not necessarily bad. The <b>encoding of case numbers</b> as a position on a common scale is effective and the <b>angular scale for month</b> allows readers to compare trends over years while placing data for each month side-by-side for easier comparison.<br/><br/>

                  While this encoding is clever, the <b>use of a spiral does add some confusion</b>. Intuitively, one might expect the width of the spiral to scale down as it approaches the center, but the cases are plotted on a constant scale, which could make it more difficult for readers to precisely understand the relative differences between each year for a given month. It is also more <b>difficult to understand the data from 2020</b> because it is plotted over a smaller total length, so it has reduced temporal resolution. Interpreting the positions of years and months took me several seconds of <b>attentive processing</b>, since this layout is not familiar, and <b>only four of the months were labeled</b>. It was not immediately clear where one year ended and another began. The author discusses how reported case numbers are delayed over holidays like Christmas, but this <b>insight is somewhat obscured by the spiral</b>; the use of a spiral also means that the <b>inner and outer lines</b> look like they follow different trends when they are in fact representing the same data. The visualization <b>does not effectively use color</b>, which could have been used for gestalt grouping by adding a color scale to the case data. The layout and typography are otherwise clear, although by <b>joining the month lines in the center</b> Intuitievly, I would read the month lines as a polar scale (i.e. further from the center <i>means</i> something, and July is the opposite of January), but <b>attentive processing</b> reveals that this is wrong.<br/><br/></p></section></section> <hr width="50%" size="1px" color="#555" z-index="1"/> <section id="sketching"><h3>Redesign: Sketching</h3> <section id="S1"><h5>Sketch 1: Similar Format, Subtle Changes</h5> <picture><img src="A3/2_Sketch1.png" alt="Sketch of an redesigned visualization" style="width: 60%; height: auto; margin: auto; display:block; min-width: 300px;"/></picture> <figcaption>Sketch 1: A similar spiral diagram, but with subtle changes to address the concerns raised in the critique.

                  <br/>2. The <b>radius</b> at 2020 has been increased, so that it is easier to read that data.
                  <br/>3. I added more <b>month labels</b>, and highlighted the line dividing each year.
                  <br/>4. <b>Month lines</b> are separated in the center, so they are not confused as continuous.
                  <br/>5. A <b>color scale</b> has been added to introduce gestalt grouping.
                  <br/>6. I removed the <b>inner spiral plot</b> to avoid confusion with the outer plot.
                  <br/>7. I was hoping this sketch would <b>communicate more clearly</b> the same key point (rapidly increasing cases in 2022).

                  <br/><br/><i>Evaluation and next steps</i> <br/>1. The <b>key point</b> remains highlighted at the top of the visualization.
                  <br/>2. The <b>color scale</b> is effective at drawing attention to key parts of the visualization.
                  <br/>3. By keeping the <b>spiral</b> pattern, there is still some scope for the confusion explained in the original critique.
                  <br/>4. This visualization remains (relatively) <b>free of clutter</b> and aesthetically appealing.
                  <br/>5. This shows that the visualization could be improved without significant changes to the visual encoding.

                  <br/><br/><i>Next, I&#39;d like to explore more drastic changes to the visual encodings.</i></p></div> <p><br/></p></section> <section id="S2"><h5>Sketch 2: Similar Encoding, Virus-Shapes Visualization</h5> <picture><img src="A3/2_Sketch2.png" alt="Sketch of an redesigned visualization" style="width: 60%; height: auto; margin: auto; display:block; min-width: 300px;"/></picture> <figcaption>Sketch 2: This circular diagram resolves the issues involved with a spiral shape, but maintains the ease of comparing monthly behavior across years.

All of the changes described in <b>sketch 1</b> have been kept, except the color scale.
                          <br/>2. <b>Year encoding</b> has been changed from spiral distance to <b>color</b>. This is possible without excessive occlusion because the number of cases increases over time, and there are only 3 years of data to overlay.
                          <br/>3. <b>Month encoding</b> remains the same (radial), but this is formatted more like a &#39;clock&#39; which non-experts might find more familiar.
                          <br/>3. <b>Labels</b> have been added to highlight key events. This provides additional context to the audience and is formatted to make the visualization <b>look like a virus</b>, adding to its visual appeal. The labels are color-coded by year.
                          <br/>4. I was hoping this sketch would <b>communicate</b> the same key point as well as <b>additional contextual information</b>.

                          <br/><br/><i>Evaluation and next steps</i> <br/>1. I like the <b>virus-like design</b> of this sketch and feel that it could be more intuitive for non-experts than the spiral design.
                          <br/>2. The <b>labels</b> provide useful context, but do make the visualization more busy. This is a trade-off.
                          <br/>3. As with all of the visualziations so far, the delay in case reporting around Christmas 2020 is somewhat <b>hidden</b> (although this is not a key point of the visualization).
                          <br/>4. The use of a separate color scale for 2022 <b>highlights the key point</b> of the visualization even better.
                          <br/>5. While this visualization looks pleasant, <b>familiarty</b> with polar coordinates remains lacking in non-expert audiences, raising the question of whether a more conventional, cartesian layout could be more effective.
                          <br/>6. This particular choice of <b>color scheme</b> provides contrast between each year, but the &#39;flow of time&#39; is not implicit in the colors. Using a more subtle change in color and brightness (for example, light pastel red to medium red, to dark red) could better convey the temporal nature of the color scheme.

                          <br/><br/><i>Next, I&#39;d like to explore a more familiar/ conventional layout using cartesian coordinates.</i></p></div> <p><br/></p></section> <section id="S3"><h5>Sketch 3: More conventional encoding</h5> <picture><img src="A3/2_Sketch3.png" alt="Sketch of an redesigned visualization" style="width: 60%; height: auto; margin: auto; display:block; min-width: 300px;"/></picture> <figcaption>Sketch 3: A re-designed visualization using a more conventional rectilinear layout with color-coded boxes and a line graph style encoding.</figcaption> <p><br/></p> <div class="processing-box"><p><b>Sketch 3</b> <br/><br/><i>Changes and rationale</i> <br/>1. This sketch experiments with new <b>month and year encoding</b>, in a grid format, which might be more familiar to readers than the radial encoding.
                          <br/>2. Instead of overlaying several lines, years were <b>stacked</b> on top of each other.
                          <br/>3. The stacking allows for boxes to be <b>color-coded</b> by the number of cases.
                          <br/>4. The <b>line plot</b> show case numbers is clear and simple to interpret.
                          <br/>5. The <b>title</b> make the source of the data clearer.
                          <br/>6. <b>Symbols</b> encode the <b>gradient</b> of the line, to try to better highlight trends.
                          <br/>7. I was hoping this would provide a more <b>familiar encoding/ layout</b> for non-expert audiences.

                          <br/><br/><i>Evaluation and next steps</i> <br/>1. While the layout is more <b>familiar</b>, it also introduces lots of <b>blank space</b> (e.g. most of 2022).
                          <br/>2. The <b>gradient symbols</b> over-complicate the diagram and make it more difficult to interpret. I regret adding these.
                          <br/>3. The <b>color coding</b> highlights substantial waves of cases (similar to the color coding in sketch 1).
                          <br/>4. This sketch is <b>lacking a legend for the color scale</b>.
                          <br/>5. The <b>key point</b> is much <b>less clear</b> in this visualization, since it is placed at the bottom left, and seems detached from much of the rest of the data.
                          <br/>6. The delay in reporting around Christmas is most <b>hidden</b> in this sketch.
                          <br/>7. Overall, this is my <b>least favorite</b> sketch.
                          <br/>8. <b>Overlaying</b> the years would probably have been more effective than <b>stacking</b>, but it wouldn&#39;t solve all of the problems with this layout.

                          <br/><br/><i>Next, I&#39;d like to re-visit the more aesthetic &#39;virus-shaped&#39; design (sketch 2), and refine it using the learnings from all of my sketches.</i></p></div> <p><br/></p></section></section> <hr width="50%" size="1px" color="#555" z-index="1"/> <section id="viz"><h3>Redesign: Final Visualization</h3> <picture><img src="A3/3_FinalViz.jpg" alt="Rendering of an redesigned visualization" style="width: 100%; height: auto; margin: auto; display:block; min-width: 300px;"/></picture> <figcaption>Final visualization: A revised visualization that uses the &#39;virus-shaped&#39; design from sketch 2, with additional refinements and additional data about the number of deaths. Illustrates COVID-19 cases and deaths reported per day as a 7-day moving average from 2020 until 6 January 2022 (the date of the original publication). The plots were produced using Matplotlib in Python, and postprocessing was completed using PowerPoint. Graphical data is based on Google COVID-19 Open Data <a href="https://health.google.com/covid-19/open-data/raw-data" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="citation">(Google, 2022)</a>, and annotations are based on the CDC COVID-19 Timeline <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/museum/timeline/covid19.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="citation">(CDC, 2022)</a>.</figcaption></section> <hr width="50%" size="1px" color="#555" z-index="1"/> <section id="writeup"><h3>Final Write-Up</h3> <p>This visualization aims to <b>communicate more points</b> from the article discussion and present a <b>balanced view</b> of the potential impacts of Omicron. It highlights the unprecedented spread of the variant, but the <b>addition of death data</b> balances the extreme spike in case numbers. To easily discern between cases and deaths, <b>icons</b> compliment text labels. The visualization aims <b>engage the non-expert audience by using virus-shaped graphs</b>. The <b>cyclical date encoding</b> has been kept, allowing for easy comparison between different years and <b>color</b> is used to encode each year, instead of the potentially confusing spiral. The color encoding also helps to highlight data from 2022 (bright red), however this scheme could be confusing for <b>colorblind readers</b>. I also wanted this visualization to provide more context to the reader, so added <b>labels with key events</b> based on CDC records. This is a trade-off, since it adds more clutter to the visualization, but it helps the reader to understand how previous outbreaks behaved, which better frames the concerns about Omicron. The <b>month dividers</b> have been separated and arranged in a more clock-like fashion, with a longer divider at the top where the year changes.
              <br/><br/>
              This design addressed many of my critiques, especially <b>removing the confusing spiral encoding and providing more context</b>. The <b>legend</b> more clearly explains how &#39;cases&#39; and &#39;deaths&#39; are defined. Mention of 7-day averaging is removed from the plot, but included in the caption (since it is unlikely to be of concern to the layperson). All months are labeled, and the additional event labels help provide context, at the cost of a more busy-looking graph (which likely requires <i>more</i> <b>attentive processing</b> than the original). The <b>circular axes</b> remain more difficult to interpret than a conventional linear axis, but this choice enabled the virus-shaped effect. <b>Occlusion</b> does make it more difficult to interpret the data, especially when case and death numbers are small, although these regions are not particularly important. The different scales, while annotated, are also not immediately clear to the reader, who might be inclined to think that deaths exceeded cases; in reality, the number of deaths is 100 times smaller than the number of cases, so deaths would not be visible if both graphs used the same scale.
