Cards illustrate prolific white officers with repeated substantiated complaints from black complainants. The line chart shows a consistent logarithmic distribution of the number of substantiated complaints per officer, up to 10 complaints per officer. Beyond that point, there are clearly a set of outliers who are mostly white. The animated heatmap illustrates how white officers and black complainants significantly outnumber any other type of complaint, and this trend remains when considering only &#39;repeat offenders&#39;.</figcaption></figure> <p><br></p> <div class="processing-box" style="width: 100%;"><p><b>Decisions and Rationale</b><br> </p><ol><li><b>Intentional selection of white officers with the most (substantiated) black complainants</b>. The &#39;cards&#39; feature a curated set of officers and many of the complaints correspond to isolated incidents rather than repeated patterns of misconduct; the listed &#39;number of complaints&#39; includes unsubstantiated complaints, which often make up the bulk of the officer&#39;s record. The stamps and use of individual&#39;s names helps to make this visualization emotive, although this could potentially dissuade viewers with bias against the presupposition who might percieve it as a dishonest attempt to bring emotion into the data.<br> <span style="color: var(--color-scale-0);"><b>-2.0</b> <i>Fully deceptive</i></span></li> <br> <li><b>The logarithmic scale for the bar chart</b> highlights the outliers, when they actually correspond to a very small number of officers. I initially tried this in good faith because the linear scale made it impossible to see the outliers, but I then realized that it makes the outliers look much more significant than they actually are. This helps persuade the viewer in support of the proposition, but it is deceptive.<br> <span style="color: var(--color-scale-1);"><b>-1.5</b> <i>Somewhat deceptive</i></span></li> <br> <li><b>Highlighting repeat offenders</b>, including a note that most of them do not have complaints recorded later than 2015. This helps to highlight the key point, drawing the viewers to interpret the graph in support of the proposition. The note about data being from before 2015 adds to the visualization&#39;s integrity and might lead viewers to trust the data more, at the cost of admitting that the conclusions are not necessarily valid in more recent years.<br> <span style="color: var(--color-scale-4);"><b>2.0</b> <i>Fully earnest</i></span></li> <br> <li><b>Normalization of heatmap by populations</b>; this normalization method was specifically chosen beacuse it highlights racial bias the most. There are many ways to normalize the data and this visualization uses the total population of each ethnicity within New York City. This offsets the effects of different populations, but fails to account for socio-economic factors; for example, there are correlations between income or education and crime rate, which could cause the correlations in racial data.<br> <span style="color: var(--color-scale-3);"><b>1.0</b> <i>Somewhat earnest</i></span></li> <br> <li><b>A complicated set of charts within one visualization</b>. This helps to maximize the amount of data available to the viewer, which might help to convince some data-enthusiastic viewers. However, it comes at the cost of clarity, and the viewer must spend time understanding and interpreting the different components. For example, only one heatmap necessary to convey the point and &#39;complaints per 10 million citizens per officer&#39; is not an intuitive metric. This is partly a symptom of the complexity of the data, but potentially inclines viewers to blindly trust the author&#39;s conclusions rather than fully understanding the data. The use of several visualization types does also help convince viewers that the discrepancy is not just a symptom of one particular visualization method.<br> <span style="color: var(--color-scale-2);"><b>-0.5</b> <i>Somewhat deceptive</i></span></li></ol></div> <p><br></p></section> <section id="V_viz2"> <h5>Visualization Against the Proposition</h5> <figure><picture><img src="A4/For.jpg" alt="Visualization against the proposition" style="width: 100%; height: auto; margin: auto; display:block; min-width: 300px;"></picture> <br> <picture><img src="A4/For_2.jpg" alt="Visualization against the proposition" style="width: 60%; height: auto; margin: auto; display:block; min-width: 300px;"></picture> <br> <picture><img src="A4/For_3.gif" alt="Visualization against the proposition" style="width: 75%; height: auto; margin: auto; display:block; min-width: 300px;"></picture> <figcaption>Visualization of NYPD complaints data <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/datastore/#civilian-complaints-against-new-york-city-police-officers" class="citation">(ProPublica, from NYC CCRB, 2020)</a> with additional demographic data on the New York City prison population <a href="https://www.criminaljustice.ny.gov/crimnet/ojsa/comparison-population-arrests-prison-demographics/2019%20Population%20Arrests%20Prison%20by%20Race.pdf" class="citation">(New York Division of Criminal Justice Services, 2020)</a> and police demographic data <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/ccrb/policy/data-transparency-initiative-mos.page" class="citation">(NYPD, 2020)</a>. Cards higlight false accusations against white officers, often from black complainants. The line chart shows how more unsubstantiated complaints are made against white (and asian) officers than their counterparts (adjusted for the number of officers of each ethnicity), suggesting that civilians are more likely to complain about a white officer than a black officer, and suggesting that civilian bias against white officers could be the cause of the disparity in complaint data, rather than officer bias. The animated heatmap illustrates how, when adjusted for socio-economic factors by using prison population, there is no correlation between the complainant ethnicity and the number of complaints; although white officers receive an excessive number of complaints from people of all racial backgrounds.</figcaption></figure> <p><br></p> <div class="processing-box" style="width: 100%;"><p><b>Decisions and Rationale</b><br> </p><ol><li><b>Intentional selection of black complainants with the most unsubstantiated complainants against white officers</b>.

This fails to demonstrate how white officers receive more overall complaints, with a similar ratio of substantiated to unsubstantiated complaints. If it is assumed that a certain ratio of complaints are always false, then the data can only tell us that white officers receive more overall complaints (rightly or wrongly), which doesn&#39;t tell us whether they commit more misconduct, or whether citizens are simply more likely to complain about white officers.<br> <span style="color: var(--color-scale-1);"><b>-1.0</b> <i>Somewhat deceptive</i></span></li> <br> <li><b>Labels to highlight ratio of unsubstantiated complaints to number of officers.</b> These labels are accurate, but as explained above, they don&#39;t account for differences in the number of substantiated complaints.<br> <span style="color: var(--color-scale-4);"><b>1.5</b> <i>Somewhat earnest</i></span></li> <br> <li><b>Normalizing complaint heatmap by number of prisoners of the same ethnicity.</b> This was specifically chosen because it does not imply bias against black complainants and prison population is a reasonable way to account for socio-economic factors, which would not be captured if adjusting by population alone. It does, however, rely on the assumption that the court system is fair and unbiased, so that the quantity of prisoners is representative of the quantity of that ethnicity implicated in crime.<br> <span style="color: var(--color-scale-3);"><b>1.0</b> <i>Somewhat earnest</i></span></li></ol></div> <p><br></p></section></section>  <hr width="50%" size="1px" color="#555" z-index="1"> <section id="writeup"><h3>Final Write-Up</h3> <p>Overall, this task helped me to understand how data can be manipulated to support opposing views and I found it interesting that I could justify different analysis methods that yield opposite conclusions. If anything, I feel that <b>this data is actually inadequate for answering the proposition</b>, but sufficient for <i>looking like</i> it presents a clear answer. In reality, our presuppositions about race, police, and crime are more likely to frame how we view the data than any implicit truth in the visualizations. This proposition requires a more qualitative analysis to understand the relationships between police, civilians, and ethnic groups.<br><br>
                
                I enjoyed thinking about ways to make the visualizations more emotive, and concluded that the &#39;cards&#39; with details of specific incidents would be effective for arguments on both sides. The heatmap visualizations were also interesting to me, because they could use near-identical data to reach opposite conclusions and yet both methodologies seemed robust to me. I was surprised by how blurry the line felt between &#39;persuasive&#39; design choices and &#39;misleading&#39; ones, and often the choices were a trade-off between two bad options (for example, the logarithmic scale v.s. cropping a linear scale, where some degree of clarity is lost whatever choice is made). There are a few generaliaztions I would make based on this task;</p> <ul><li>It is definitely <b>not acceptable to pick and choose data</b> to support a predetermined conclusion, as I demonstrated in the &#39;cards&#39; part of each visualization.</li> <li>I would argue that it is <b>ok to choose different normalization/ analysis methods</b> depending on how you view a problem (for example, the heatmap normalization), although it is best practice to be <b>transparent about the benefits and pitfalls of different methods.</b></li> <li>It is <b>not good practice to suggest that data can answer a question that it is not designed to answer</b>; this applies to arguments on both sides of the proposition. The data simply does not contain enough information to draw a conclusion, so the most critical ethical choice was using the data for the proposition in the first place.</li> <li>I would <b>define &quot;ethical analysis and visualization&quot; as an honest attempt to use data to answer a question, while recognizing the pitfalls of any analysis</b>. This allows for two sides of an argument to both conduct ethical, yet contradictory, analyses; the problem as I see it is when we <b>draw conclusions about qualitative, social issues from quantitatve data</b> -- no amount of ethics can solve the inherent issues with using data alone to evaluate social issues.</li></ul></section></div></main>`;
