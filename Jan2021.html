            <p class="wrapper">In preparation for the launch of APEX, the Altitude Record Team were asked to develop a lower altitude prototype, using a less powerful motor, in order to gain experience at a lower level. I was tasked with designing the test bed rocket by adapting existing components. The purpose of this rocket, ASTRA, would be to demonstrate the team's ability to design and launch a rocket effectively, as well as testing the accuracy of various components to be used on future rockets.<br/><br/></p>

            <p class="wrapper"><br/>To begin with, it was decided that phenolic resin body tubes were to be used, purchased from a respected amateur rocketry supplier. By using body tubes with a larger internal diameter than APEX's planned body, it was easy to include the recovery and avionics systems designed for APEX, with relatively little change. This meant that testing and validation of the systems could be conducted prior to the team's first altitude record attempt.<br/><br/>ASTRA's initial design was implemented in <a href="https://openrocket.info" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OpenRocket</a>, an open-source amateur rocket design software, which runs simple simulations to predict important performance criteria. While the program's models are not accurate in transonic or supersonic flight, they provide suitable estimations for rocket performance and apogee. Perhaps most importantly, OpenRocket is used to verify the static stability of the rocket, which is explained in more detail on APEX's page. The initial openRocket model helped to select a G-Class motor to bring the rocket to an apogee of approxiamtely 700m. Fin sizes were estimated, with a target static margin of 1.3 calibres, before the design was developed further in Fusion360.<br/><br/>Creating a developed design in Fusion360 was an essential step in ensuring that the proposed components could be assembled as planned. Section and curvature analysis tools were used to check the design for potential problems, and the rendering environment made it easy to visualise the rocket. Using the Fusion360 model, it was also easy to 3D print components such as the nosecone and fin can.<br/><br/>ASTRA is scheduled to launch on Sunday 11th April 2021... watch this space for updates!<br/><br/></p>
