      <h2>Numerical simulation of the lightning swept stroke for zoning unconventional aircraft.<br/><br/></h2>
      
      <p>For my masters' thesis, I developed a physics-based model for the 'swept-stroke' phase of lightning strikes on aircraft under the supervision of Prof. Guerra-Garcia in the <a href="apg.mit.edu">MIT Aerospace Plasma Group.</a> The work is summarised in my master's thesis and published in several papers which will be linked below as they are released publicly.<br/><br/></p>
